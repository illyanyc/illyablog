My personal webpage was built with the help of:

1. [Publishing website on Google Cloud - CodeLabs](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/cloud-webapp-hosting-gcs#0) : how to host a static site on GCP.
2. [Automated publishing on Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/community/tutorials/automated-publishing-cloud-build) : setting up GitHub updates to the site via <code>Triggers</code> and <code>cloudbuild.yaml</code>.


Additional literature:
1. [Hosting static website on Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/hosting-static-website) : HTTPS, SSL, IPv4 and load balancing.
2. [Moving and renaming buckes](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/moving-buckets) : bucker data transfer via <code>Transfer</code>.
